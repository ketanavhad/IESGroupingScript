# IESGroupingScript
A script for grouping zones in IES based on their names - with a single click and controlled with an Excel input sheet.

### Grouping script guidance:
- Select the grouping scheme from the drop down list
- Click on to Hyperlink to review the groups to be created and the related search terms
- If required, you can create a custom grouping scheme, select 'Custom'. Go in the 'Custom' sheet and amend the groups and search term columns. Keep in mind that the script does the grouping from the top to the bottom and that ","=OR (multiple "," can be used) and "+"=AND (only one "+" can be used)
- if you need to add a new Grouping scheme to the datasheet, add a new tab and then 'Refresh sheet Names'. After doing that contact the Production Team to get this included in the datasheet saved on the server
- Save the file
- Run the script
- Review the grouping 
-if the grouping was wrong, review the search terms, amend the search terms and run the script again. Liaise with Production Team to update potentially the search terms of any given grouping scheme. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110020070/221897972-920ef918-cb58-45d4-a183-9c84da12397e.png)
